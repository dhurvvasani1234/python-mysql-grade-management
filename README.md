# Python MySQL Grade Management System

This project is a simple Python-based Grade Management System that connects to a MySQL database. It allows users to insert, display, and delete grade records via a command-line interface. The script uses `mysql-connector-python` to manage database interactions and a configuration file (`config.ini`) for database credentials.
